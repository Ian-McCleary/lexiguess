1. The program that we are implementing is a version of hangman that uses a client and server application. The server will handle word generation and checking to see if a 
guessed letter is contained in the word. The client will be guessing the word and will input one letter at a time to see if it is contained in the secret word. If the client is able to
guess the word correctly, they win! If the client runs out of guesses, then they lose.


2. We anticipate that the most challenging part of the assignment will be setting up the client-server connection and effectively transfering information over the socket. We
have little experience with using sockets or the socket api, so we will probably need to read up on the documentation beforehand.
